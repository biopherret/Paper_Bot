# How to access paper bot
Follow [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1252693045938491483) to add the bot to either a server you have admin privileges for or select "try it now" to use it without adding it to a server.

# Getting Started
To make a user profile simply add your first topic of interest

Then you can find papers either at will using the /find_papers_now command

In both cases Paper Bot will find related papers and send you links to them. And then work on summarizing them.

You'll notice that Paper Bot was not able to summarize every paper, this is often because the journal website blocks web scraping, so Paper Bot isn't able to get the paper content. 

When this happens, you can use the links provided in the first message to find a pdf of the paper directly ask for a summary using /summarize_pdf
